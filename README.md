# udacity-data-analyst-degree
Taking the [Udacity Data Analyst nano degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) as I want to learn and explore the data science world. 
I have a mechanical engineering background and have, since my uni-time, been passionately interested in
programming. 

My project work will be uploaded here.

### Project 1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Using descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.
